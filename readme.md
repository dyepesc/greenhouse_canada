## Understanding the Charts

### 1. Geographical Distribution Map
- Colors represent emission intensity (darker = higher emissions)
- Hover over provinces to see exact values
- Compare regional patterns
- Look for unexpected high/low emission areas

### 2. Historical Trends Line Chart
- X-axis shows years (2004-2024)
- Y-axis shows total emissions (metric tonnes)
- Observe overall trends (increasing/decreasing)

### 3. Top Contributors Bar Chart
- Shows top 5 emitting provinces
- Bars ordered from highest to lowest
- You can compare relative contributions
- You can note the gap between top contributors
